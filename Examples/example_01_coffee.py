'''
A set of tools for solving Newton's law of cooling, i.e.,

$\frac{d T(t)}{dt} = k \left(T_{env} - T(t) \right)$

...where values and units are defined below.

Within this module are functions to return the analytic solution of the heat
equation, numerically solve it, find the time to arrive at a certain
temperature, and visualize the results.

The following table sets the values and their units used throughout this code:

| Symbol | Units  | Value/Meaning                                            |
|--------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------|
|T(t)    | C or K | Surface temperature of body in question                  |
|T_init  | C or K | Initial temperature of body in question                  |
|T_env   | C or K | Temperature of the ambient environment                   |
|k       | 1/s    | Heat transfer coefficient                                |
|t       | s      | Time in seconds                                          |

DAN TEACHING NOTES:
1) Start by mapping out what we want as our end goal:
   - Temperature vs. time for each scenario. <- FUNCTION #1!
   - The time it takes in seconds to cool to our target. <- FUNCTION #2!
2) List out the inputs and outputs for this!
    - Inputs: time, ambient temp, initial temp, heat transfer coeff.
    - Outputs: temperature for each time in input time.
3) Start by just hard coding everything.
    - Everything as a top-to-bottom script, hard coded.
    - Boy, changing this stuff by hand sure sucks.
4) Then, turn into two functions.
    - Show how easy it is to quickly change things.
5) Finally, build a function to answer the final question.
    - Create the final plot and deliverable.
    - Build the plot component wise, adding better titles and labels as we
      go. Contrast against initial plot that sucks.

def coffee_problem1(T_env=21.0):
    '''
    This function solves the following problem:

    A cup of coffee is 90°C and is too hot to drink. You like cream in
    your coffee and adding it will cool the coffee instantaneously
    by 5°C. The coffee needs to cool until 60°C before it is
    drinkable. When should you add the creamer to get the coffee drinkable
    fastest- right away, or once it is already cooled to 60°C?

    It does so by setting an arbitrary heat transfer constant and
    plotting the cooling curves over 10 minutes for the creamer case and
    non-creamer case. The time-to-60°C is marked for each case.
    The ambient temperature is set to 21°C.

    Finally, we consider the "smart" solution where we let the coffee
    sit until it cools to 65°C and then pour in the cream to get to 60°C.
